This is the generation code for the dataset presented in WACV 2021:

# [EDEN: Multimodal Synthetic Dataset of Enclosed GarDEN Scenes](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Le_EDEN_Multimodal_Synthetic_Dataset_of_Enclosed_GarDEN_Scenes_WACV_2021_paper.pdf)

[arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04389)

Part of the dataset has been used for the challenge at ECCV'2018 workshop of 3D Reconstruction meets Semantics by @TrimBot2020. For more information, please refer to the [3DRMS challenge](https://github.com/TrimBot2020/3DRMS_Challenge2018) and the [EDEN project page](https://lhoangan.github.io/eden)
